        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The water cycle consists of several main processes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The sun's heat causes water from oceans, lakes, and rivers to evaporate into the atmosphere in the form of water vapor.</li>
            <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> As water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.</li>
            <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> When the water droplets in clouds become heavy enough, they fall to the ground as precipitation, including rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</li>
            <li><strong>Runoff:</strong> Precipitation that falls on land can either soak into the ground (infiltration) or flow over the surface, eventually making its way back to rivers, lakes, and oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Transpiration:</strong> Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots and release it into the atmosphere through small openings in their leaves called stomata.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>The water cycle is essential for maintaining life on Earth. It helps regulate the Earth's temperature, distributes freshwater resources, and sustains ecosystems.</p>
